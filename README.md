# Javascript Exercises

Repository of Javascript exercises that I have collected &amp; created with the intention of adding exercises for beginners to intermediate level to help newcomers to the Javascript language.

## How to use

Just clone with `git clone https://github.com/Mario-Duarte/javascript-exercises` or fork the repository into your account and create a local clone of your fork. (more details on this can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork))

Be sure to [keep your fork synced](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#keep-your-fork-synced) to get the latest exercises.
